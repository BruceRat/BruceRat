- 👋 Hi, I’m @BruceRat
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching.  I've been teaching high school science for 48 years and am hoping for 20 more.  As you can guess, I love my "job".  But many of my colleagues don't.  In some cases they are pressured by admin to stay within the confines of what The Standards declare are the only lessons worth teaching.  Every month, my student write their WIL.  (What I Learned),  about anything important to them.  For last month's WIL (Prompt:  Step Outside My Comfort Zone), 5 kids turned in their WIL 12 days early.  The minimum word requirement is 250 words.  The average length was 375 words.  My classes as I are trying to get a book published featuring their WILs.  We're having a hard time.  Any suggestions?
